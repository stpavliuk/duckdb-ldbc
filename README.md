# Ldbc

This repository is based on https://github.com/duckdb/extension-template, check it out if you want to build and ship
your own DuckDB extension.

---

This extension is a DuckDB extension scaffold for LDBC SNB support.

## Building

### Build steps

Now to build the extension, run:

```sh
make
```

You can also use Ninja:

```sh
GEN=ninja make
GEN=ninja make debug
```

The main binaries that will be built are:

```sh
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/test/unittest
./build/release/extension/ldbc/ldbc.duckdb_extension
```

- `duckdb` is the binary for the duckdb shell with the extension code automatically loaded.
- `unittest` is the test runner of duckdb. Again, the extension is already linked into the binary.
- `ldbc.duckdb_extension` is the loadable binary as it would be distributed.

## Running the extension

To run the extension code, simply start the shell with `./build/release/duckdb`.

Now we can use the extension entry points directly in DuckDB:

```
D SELECT success FROM snb_datagen(overwrite := true, download := false, data_path := 'test/data/SNB0.003-mini');
┌─────────┐
│ success │
│ boolean │
├─────────┤
│ true    │
└─────────┘

D SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Person;

-- inspect available PGQ queries and default parameters
D SELECT category, query_nr, parameters FROM snb_queries();

-- preview a specific query (raw + default-substituted text)
D PRAGMA snb(7);

-- execute a specific PGQ query (requires duckpgq extension)
D PRAGMA snb_execute(7);

-- load from LDBC DuckLake (sf: 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10)
D SELECT success FROM snb_datagen(download := true, sf := 0.1, overwrite := true);
```

## Running the tests

Different tests can be created for DuckDB extensions. The primary way of testing DuckDB extensions should be the SQL
tests in `./test/sql`. These SQL tests can be run using:

```sh
make test
```

### Installing the deployed binaries

To install your extension binaries from S3, you will need to do two things. Firstly, DuckDB should be launched with the
`allow_unsigned_extensions` option set to true. How to set this will depend on the client you're using. Some examples:

CLI:

```shell
duckdb -unsigned
```

Python:

```python
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:', config={'allow_unsigned_extensions': 'true'})
```

NodeJS:

```js
db = new duckdb.Database(':memory:', {"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"});
```

Secondly, you will need to set the repository endpoint in DuckDB to the HTTP url of your bucket + version of the
extension
you want to install. To do this run the following SQL query in DuckDB:

```sql
SET
custom_extension_repository='bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<your_extension_name>/latest';
```

Note that the `/latest` path will allow you to install the latest extension version available for your current version
of
DuckDB. To specify a specific version, you can pass the version instead.

After running these steps, you can install and load your extension using the regular INSTALL/LOAD commands in DuckDB:

```sql
INSTALL ldbc;

LOAD ldbc;
```

## Setting up CLion

### Opening project

Configuring CLion with this extension requires a little work. Firstly, make sure that the DuckDB submodule is available.
Then make sure to open `./duckdb/CMakeLists.txt` (so not the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file from this repo) as a
project in CLion.
Now to fix your project path go to
`tools->CMake->Change Project Root`([docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/change-project-root-directory.html)) to
set the project root to the root dir of this repo.

### Debugging

To set up debugging in CLion, there are two simple steps required. Firstly, in
`CLion -> Settings / Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deploy -> CMake` you will need to add the desired builds (e.g.
Debug, Release, RelDebug, etc). There's different ways to configure this, but the easiest is to leave all empty, except
the `build path`, which needs to be set to `../build/{build type}`, and CMake Options to which the following flag should
be added, with the path to the extension CMakeList:

```
-DDUCKDB_EXTENSION_CONFIGS=<path_to_the_exentension_CMakeLists.txt>
```

The second step is to configure the unittest runner as a run/debug configuration. To do this, go to
`Run -> Edit Configurations` and click `+ -> Cmake Application`. The target and executable should be `unittest`. This
will run all the DuckDB tests. To specify only running the extension specific tests, add `--test-dir ../../.. [sql]` to
the `Program Arguments`. Note that it is recommended to use the `unittest` executable for testing/development within
CLion. The actual DuckDB CLI currently does not reliably work as a run target in CLion.
